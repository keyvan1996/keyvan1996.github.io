Updated periodically.</h4>\n<p>\u201cStories, like people and butterflies and songbirds\u2019 eggs and human hearts and dreams, are also fragile things, made up of nothing stronger or more lasting than twenty-six letters and a handful of punctuation marks. Or they are words on the air, composed of sounds and ideas\u200a\u2014\u200aabstract, invisible, gone once they\u2019ve been spoken\u200a\u2014\u200aand what could be more frail than that? But some stories, small, simple ones about setting out on adventures or people doing wonders, tales of miracles and monsters, have outlasted all the people who told them, and some of them have outlasted the lands in which they were created.\u201d<br>\u2014 Neil\u00a0Gaiman</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.\u201d<br>\u2014 Paul Kalanithi</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you come to one of the many moments in life when you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man\u2019s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more, but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.\u201d<br>\u2014 Paul Kalanithi</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed to weep; \u2019tis right to grieve. Tears are only water, and flowers, trees, and fruit cannot grow without water. But there must be sunlight also. A wounded heart will heal in time, and when it does, the memory and love of our lost ones is sealed inside to comfort us.\u201d<br>\u2014 Brian\u00a0Jacques</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe our favorite quotations say more about us than about the stories and people we\u2019re quoting.\u201d<br>\u2014 John\u00a0Green</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems to me that when it\u2019s time to die, there would be a certain pleasure in thinking that you had utilized your life well, learned as much as you could, gathered in as much as possible of the universe, and enjoyed it. There\u2019s only this one universe and only this one lifetime to try to grasp it. And while it is inconceivable that anyone can grasp more than a tiny portion of it, at least you can do that much. What a tragedy just to pass through and get nothing out of it.\u201d<br>\u2014 Isaac Asimov (<a href=\"http://zenpencils.com/comic/asimov/\">Zen\u00a0Pencils</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd even if we are occupied with most important things, if we attain to honour or fall into great misfortune\u200a\u2014\u200astill let us remember how good it was once here, when we were all together, united by a good and kind feeling which made us\u2026 better perhaps than we are.\u201d<br>\u2014 Fyodor Dostoyevsky</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I were dropped out of a plane into the ocean and told the nearest land was a thousand miles away, I\u2019d still swim. And I\u2019d despise the one who gave up.\u201d<br>\u2014 Abraham\u00a0Maslow</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the real world, equal respect for all cultures doesn\u2019t translate into a rich mosaic of colorful and proud peoples interacting peacefully while maintaining a delightful diversity of food and craftwork. It translates into closed pockets of oppression, ignorance, and abuse.\u201d<br>\u2014 Ayaan Hirsi\u00a0Ali</p>\n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They\u2019re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can\u2019t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.\u201d<br>\u2014\u00a0Apple</p>\n<p>\u201cIf only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?\u201d<br>\u2014 Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are as forlorn as children lost in the woods. When you stand in front of me and look at me, what do you know of the griefs that are in me and what do I know of yours. And if I were to cast myself down before you and weep and tell you, what more would you know about me than you know about Hell when someone tells you it is hot and dreadful? For that reason alone we human beings ought to stand before one another as reverently, as reflectively, as lovingly, as we would before the entrance to Hell.\u201d<br>\u2014 Franz\u00a0Kafka</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out \u2014<br>Because I was not a Socialist.</p>\n<p>Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out \u2014<br>Because I was not a Trade Unionist.</p>\n<p>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out \u2014<br>Because I was not a\u00a0Jew.</p>\n<p>Then they came for me\u200a\u2014\u200aand there was no one left to speak for me.\u201d<br>\u2014 Martin Niem\u00f6ller</p>\n<p>\u201cNormal is an illusion. What is normal for the spider is chaos for the fly.\u201d<br>\u2014 Charles\u00a0Addams</p>\n<p>\u201cThe day the child realizes that all adults are imperfect, he becomes an adolescent; the day he forgives them, he becomes an adult; the day he forgives himself, he becomes wise.\u201d<br>\u2014 Alden\u00a0Nowlan</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not go gentle into that good night,<br>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\u201d<br>\u2014 Dylan\u00a0Thomas</p>\n<p>\u201cThe most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen.\u201d<br>\u2014 Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I cannot create, I do not understand.\u201d<br>\u2014 Richard\u00a0Feynman</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been making a list of the things they don\u2019t teach you at school. They don\u2019t teach you how to love somebody. They don\u2019t teach you how to be famous. They don\u2019t teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don\u2019t teach you how to walk away from someone you don\u2019t love any longer. They don\u2019t teach you how to know what\u2019s going on in someone else\u2019s mind. They don\u2019t teach you what to say to someone who\u2019s dying. They don\u2019t teach you anything worth knowing.\u201d<br>\u2014 Neil\u00a0Gaiman</p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody has a secret world inside of them. All of the people in the whole world, I mean everybody. No matter how dull and boring they are on the outside. Inside them they\u2019ve all got unimaginable, magnificent, wonderful, stupid, amazing worlds. Not just one world. Hundreds of them. Thousands maybe.\u201d<br>\u2014 Neil\u00a0Gaiman</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.\u201d<br>\u2014 Alan\u00a0Watts</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the real secret of life\u2014to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.\u201d<br>\u2014 Alan\u00a0Watts</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen adults say, \u2018Teenagers think they are invincible\u2019 with that sly, stupid smile on their faces, they don\u2019t know how right they are. We need never be hopeless, because we can never be irreparably broken. We think that we are invincible because we are. We cannot be born, and we cannot die. Like all energy, we can only change shapes and sizes and manifestations. They forget that when they get old. They get scared of losing and failing. But that part of us greater than the sum of our parts cannot begin and cannot end, and so it cannot fail.\u201d<br>\u2014 John\u00a0Green</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only difference in the game of love over the last few thousand years is that they\u2019ve changed trumps from clubs to diamonds.\u201d<br>\u2014 The Indianapolis Star</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you love a flower, don\u2019t pick it up.<br>Because if you pick it up it dies and it ceases to be what you love.<br>So if you love a flower, let it be.<br>Love is not about possession.<br>Love is about appreciation.\u201d<br>\u2014\u00a0Osho</p>\n<p>\u201cTo the world you may be just one person, but to one person you may be the world.\u201d<br>\u2014 Brandi\u00a0Snyder</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not stand at my grave and weep,<br>I am not there; I do not sleep.<br>I am a thousand winds that blow,<br>I am the diamond glints on snow,<br>I am the sun on ripened grain,<br>I am the gentle autumn rain.<br>When you awaken in the morning\u2019s hush<br>I am the swift uplifting rush<br>Of quiet birds in circling flight.<br>I am the soft starlight at night.<br>Do not stand at my grave and cry,<br>I am not there; I did not die.\u201d<br>\u2014 Mary Elizabeth Frye</p>\n<p>\u201cI used to think I was the strangest person in the world but then I thought there are so many people in the world, there must be someone just like me who feels bizarre and flawed in the same ways I do. I would imagine her, and imagine that she must be out there thinking of me too. Well, I hope that if you are out there and read this and know that, yes, it\u2019s true I\u2019m here, and I\u2019m just as strange as you.\u201d<br>\u2014 Frida\u00a0Kahlo</p>\n<p>\u201cAdmit it. You aren\u2019t like them. You\u2019re not even close. You may occasionally dress yourself up as one of them, watch the same mindless television shows as they do, maybe even eat the same fast food sometimes. But it seems that the more you try to fit in, the more you feel like an outsider, watching the \u2018normal people\u2019 as they go about their automatic existences. For every time you say club passwords like \u2018Have a nice day\u2019 and \u2018Weather\u2019s awful today, eh?\u2019, you yearn inside to say forbidden things like \u2018Tell me something that makes you cry\u2019 or \u2018What do you think <em>deja vu</em> is for?\u2019. Face it, you even want to talk to that girl in the elevator. But what if that girl in the elevator (and the balding man who walks past your cubicle at work) are thinking the same thing? Who knows what you might learn from taking a chance on conversation with a stranger? Everyone carries a piece of the puzzle. Nobody comes into your life by mere coincidence. Trust your instincts. Do the unexpected. Find the others.\u201d<br>\u2014 Timothy Leary (<a href=\"http://zenpencils.com/comic/102-timothy-leary-you-arent-like-them/\">Zen\u00a0Pencils</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.\u201d<br>\u2014 George\u00a0Orwell</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can\u2019t achieve it.\u201d<br>\u2014 Jordan\u00a0Belfort</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.\u201d<br>\u2014\u00a0Plato</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve those who seek the truth, doubt those who find it.\u201d<br>\u2014 Andr\u00e9\u00a0Gide</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.\u201d<br>\u2014 Ralph Waldo\u00a0Emerson</p>\n<p>\u201cPain is temporary. It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year, but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place. If I quit, however, it lasts forever.\u201d<br>\u2014 Lance Armstrong</p>\n<p>\u201cThe secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.\u201d<br>\u2014 Mark\u00a0Twain</p>\n<p>\u201cQuiet people have the loudest minds.\u201d<br>\u2014 Stephen\u00a0Hawking</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it\u2019s different. Consider again that dot. That\u2019s here. That\u2019s home. That\u2019s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every \u2018superstar,\u2019 every \u2018supreme leader,\u2019 every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there\u2014on a mote of dust suspended in a\u00a0sunbeam.</p>\n<p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity\u2014in all this vastness\u2014there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.</p>\n<p>The Earth is the only world known, so far, to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we\u2019ve ever known.\u201d<br>\u2014 Carl Sagan (<a href=\"http://zenpencils.com/comic/100-carl-sagan-pale-blue-dot/\">Zen\u00a0Pencils</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are two types of sufferers in this world: those that suffer from a lack of life and those that suffer from an overabundance of it.\u201d<br>\u2014 Louis Mackey (Waking\u00a0Life)</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it\u2019s just not that good. It\u2019s trying to be good, it has potential, but it\u2019s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn\u2019t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it\u2019s normal, and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. It\u2019s gonna take awhile. It\u2019s normal to take awhile. You\u2019ve just gotta fight your way through.\u201d<br>\u2014 Ira Glass (<a href=\"http://zenpencils.com/comic/90-ira-glass-advice-for-beginners/\">Zen Pencils</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"http://youtu.be/BI23U7U2aUY\">YouTube</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you think I\u2019m a loser? Just because I have a stinking job that I hate, a family that doesn\u2019t respect me, a whole city that curses the day I was born? Well, that may mean loser to you, but let me tell you something. Every morning when I wake up, I know it\u2019s not going to get any better until I go back to sleep again. So I get up, have my watered down Tang and still-frozen Pop Tart, get in my car with no upholstery, no gas and six more payments to fight traffic just for the privilege of putting cheap shoes on the cloven hooves of people like you. I\u2019ll never play football like I thought I would, I\u2019ll never know the touch of a beautiful woman, and I\u2019ll never again know the joy of driving without a bag on my head. But I\u2019m not a loser. \u2018Cause despite it all, me and every other guy who\u2019ll never be what he wanted to be, are still out there, being what we don\u2019t wanna be, forty hours a week, for life. And the fact that I haven\u2019t put a gun to my mouth, you pudding of a woman, makes me a winner!\u201d<br>\u2014 Al\u00a0Bundy</p>\n<p>\u201cThe reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less\u00a0money.</p>\n<p>Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the\u00a0cobbles.</p>\n<p>But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that\u2019d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years\u2019 time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet\u00a0feet.</p>\n<p>This was the Captain Samuel Vimes \u2018Boots\u2019 theory of socioeconomic unfairness.\u201d<br>\u2014 Terry Pratchett</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re good at something, you\u2019ll tell everyone. When you\u2019re great at something, they\u2019ll tell you.\u201d<br>\u2014 Walter\u00a0Payton</p>\n<p>\u201cThe idea that some lives matter less is the root of all that\u2019s wrong with the world.\u201d<br>\u2014 Paul\u00a0Farmer</p>\n<p>\u201cIt suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn\u2019t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.\u201d<br>\u2014 Neil Armstrong (<a href=\"http://zenpencils.com/comic/76-neil-armstrong-a-giant-among-men/\">Zen\u00a0Pencils</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.\u201d<br>\u2014 Helen Keller (<a href=\"http://zenpencils.com/comic/79-helen-keller-when-one-door-closes/\">Zen\u00a0Pencils</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cSurely, if life means anything at all, it means that each of us is entrusted with a certain irreplaceable fund of hours and weeks and years. To let anybody and everybody fritter that fund away is as if the trustee of an estate were to deposit the estate\u2019s funds in a bank and issue check books to whoever applied.\u201d<br>\u2014 Anonymous (<a href=\"http://mikecanex.wordpress.com/2012/12/26/1922-why-i-quit-being-so-accommodating/\">The American Magazine</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cA long time from now will be now really soon.\u201d<br>\u2014 Tim Scott\u00a0(<a href=\"http://qr.ae/Ig3y2\">Quora</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cWe tend to greatly overestimate what we can achieve in the next 10 months and greatly underestimate what we can achieve in the next 10 years.\u201d<br>\u2014 Tim Scott\u00a0(<a href=\"http://qr.ae/Ig3y2\">Quora</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014<br>I took the one less traveled by,<br>And that has made all the difference.\u201d<br>\u2014 Robert Frost (<a href=\"http://zenpencils.com/comic/60-robert-frost-the-road-not-taken/\">Zen\u00a0Pencils</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes I lie awake at night, and ask, \u2018Where have I gone wrong?\u2019 Then a voice says to me, \u2018This is going to take more than one night.\u2019\u201d<br>\u2014 Charles M.\u00a0Schulz</p>\n<p>\u201cI love mankind; it\u2019s people I can\u2019t stand.\u201d<br>\u2014 Charles M.\u00a0Schulz</p>\n<p>\u201cAll you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d<br>\u2014 Charles M.\u00a0Schulz</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve discovered the secret of life\u2014you just hang around until you get used to it.\u201d<br>\u2014 Charles M.\u00a0Schulz</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re happy, you enjoy the music. But when you\u2019re sad, you understand the lyrics.\u201d<br>\u2014 Frank\u00a0Ocean</p>\n<p>\u201cWar does not determine who is right\u2014only who is left.\u201d<br>\u2014 Bertrand\u00a0Russell</p>\n<p>\u201cI always wonder why birds choose to stay in the same place when they can fly anywhere on the earth. Then I ask myself the same question.\u201d<br>\u2014 Harun\u00a0Yahya</p>\n<p>\u201cSome people say, \u2018How can you live without knowing?\u2019 I do not know what they mean. I always live without knowing. That is easy. How you get to know is what I want to know.\u201d<br>\u2014 Richard\u00a0Feynman</p>\n<p>\u201cA poet once said, \u2018The whole universe is in a glass of wine.\u2019 We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe.\u201d<br>\u2014 Richard\u00a0Feynman</p>\n<p>\u201cAlone we can do so little; together we can do so much.\u201d<br>\u2014 Helen\u00a0Keller</p>\n<p>\u201cThe liar\u2019s punishment is not in the least that he is not believed, but that he cannot believe anyone else.\u201d<br>\u2014 George Bernard\u00a0Shaw</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you always put limits on everything you do, physical or anything else, it will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.\u201d<br>\u2014 Bruce\u00a0Lee</p>\n<p>\u201cI would rather be ashes than dust! I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot. I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. The function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. I shall use my time.\u201d<br>\u2014 Jack London (<a href=\"http://zenpencils.com/comic/111-jack-london-i-would-rather-be-ashes-than-dust/\">Zen\u00a0Pencils</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch your thoughts; they become words. Watch your words; they become actions. Watch your actions; they become habit. Watch your habits; they become character. Watch your character; it becomes your destiny.\u201d<br>\u2014 Lao\u00a0Tzu</p>\n<p>\u201cI have never met a man so ignorant that I could not learn something from him.\u201d<br>\u2014 Galileo\u00a0Galilei</p>\n<p>\u201cThe real question is not whether machines think but whether men do.\u201d<br>\u2014 B.

They have never felt the iron of it in their flesh. They do not know how mean it makes you. It exposes you to endless humiliation, it cuts your wings, it eats into your soul like a cancer.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by the dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who, at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat.\u201d<br>\u2014 Theodore Roosevelt (<a href=\"http://zenpencils.com/comic/theodore-roosevelt-the-man-in-the-arena/\">Zen\u00a0Pencils</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what you can, with what you have, where you are.\u201d<br>\u2014 Theodore Roosevelt</p>\n<p>\u201cModeration in all things, especially moderation.\u201d<br>\u2014 Ralph Waldo\u00a0Emerson</p>\n<p>\u201cOne reason we struggle with insecurity: we\u2019re comparing our behind the scenes to everyone else\u2019s highlight reel.\u201d<br>\u2014 Steven Furtick (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenfurtick/status/67981913746444288\">Twitter</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cI was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence, but it comes from within.

It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like \u2018maybe we should be just friends\u2019 turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts.

When you stand in front of me and look at me, what do you know of the griefs that are in me and what do I know of yours. And if I were to cast myself down before you and weep and tell you, what more would you know about me than you know about Hell when someone tells you it is hot and dreadful?

They don\u2019t teach you how to love somebody. They don\u2019t teach you how to be famous. They don\u2019t teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don\u2019t teach you how to walk away from someone you don\u2019t love any longer. They don\u2019t teach you how to know what\u2019s going on in someone else\u2019s mind.

Thousands maybe.\u201d<br>\u2014 Neil\u00a0Gaiman</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.\u201d<br>\u2014 Alan\u00a0Watts</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the real secret of life\u2014to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now.

We need never be hopeless, because we can never be irreparably broken. We think that we are invincible because we are. We cannot be born, and we cannot die. Like all energy, we can only change shapes and sizes and manifestations. They forget that when they get old. They get scared of losing and failing.

You aren\u2019t like them. You\u2019re not even close. You may occasionally dress yourself up as one of them, watch the same mindless television shows as they do, maybe even eat the same fast food sometimes. But it seems that the more you try to fit in, the more you feel like an outsider, watching the \u2018normal people\u2019 as they go about their automatic existences. For every time you say club passwords like \u2018Have a nice day\u2019 and \u2018Weather\u2019s awful today, eh?\u2019, you yearn inside to say forbidden things like \u2018Tell me something that makes you cry\u2019 or \u2018What do you think <em>deja vu</em> is for?\u2019. Face it, you even want to talk to that girl in the elevator. But what if that girl in the elevator (and the balding man who walks past your cubicle at work) are thinking the same thing? Who knows what you might learn from taking a chance on conversation with a stranger? Everyone carries a piece of the puzzle. Nobody comes into your life by mere coincidence. Trust your instincts. Do the unexpected. Find the others.\u201d<br>\u2014 Timothy Leary (<a href=\"http://zenpencils.com/comic/102-timothy-leary-you-arent-like-them/\">Zen\u00a0Pencils</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.\u201d<br>\u2014 George\u00a0Orwell</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can\u2019t achieve it.\u201d<br>\u2014 Jordan\u00a0Belfort</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.\u201d<br>\u2014\u00a0Plato</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve those who seek the truth, doubt those who find it.\u201d<br>\u2014 Andr\u00e9\u00a0Gide</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.\u201d<br>\u2014 Ralph Waldo\u00a0Emerson</p>\n<p>\u201cPain is temporary.

If I quit, however, it lasts forever.\u201d<br>\u2014 Lance Armstrong</p>\n<p>\u201cThe secret of getting ahead is getting started.

But for us, it\u2019s different. Consider again that dot. That\u2019s here. That\u2019s home. That\u2019s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every \u2018superstar,\u2019 every \u2018supreme leader,\u2019 every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there\u2014on a mote of dust suspended in a\u00a0sunbeam.</p>\n<p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity\u2014in all this vastness\u2014there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.</p>\n<p>The Earth is the only world known, so far, to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we\u2019ve ever known.\u201d<br>\u2014 Carl Sagan (<a href=\"http://zenpencils.com/comic/100-carl-sagan-pale-blue-dot/\">Zen\u00a0Pencils</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are two types of sufferers in this world: those that suffer from a lack of life and those that suffer from an overabundance of it.\u201d<br>\u2014 Louis Mackey (Waking\u00a0Life)</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it\u2019s just not that good. It\u2019s trying to be good, it has potential, but it\u2019s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn\u2019t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it\u2019s normal, and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. It\u2019s gonna take awhile. It\u2019s normal to take awhile. You\u2019ve just gotta fight your way through.\u201d<br>\u2014 Ira Glass (<a href=\"http://zenpencils.com/comic/90-ira-glass-advice-for-beginners/\">Zen Pencils</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"http://youtu.be/BI23U7U2aUY\">YouTube</a>)</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you think I\u2019m a loser? Just because I have a stinking job that I hate, a family that doesn\u2019t respect me, a whole city that curses the day I was born? Well, that may mean loser to you, but let me tell you something. Every morning when I wake up, I know it\u2019s not going to get any better until I go back to sleep again. So I get up, have my watered down Tang and still-frozen Pop Tart, get in my car with no upholstery, no gas and six more payments to fight traffic just for the privilege of putting cheap shoes on the cloven hooves of people like you. I\u2019ll never play football like I thought I would, I\u2019ll never know the touch of a beautiful woman, and I\u2019ll never again know the joy of driving without a bag on my head. But I\u2019m not a loser. \u2018Cause despite it all, me and every other guy who\u2019ll never be what he wanted to be, are still out there, being what we don\u2019t wanna be, forty hours a week, for life. And the fact that I haven\u2019t put a gun to my mouth, you pudding of a woman, makes me a winner!\u201d<br>\u2014 Al\u00a0Bundy</p>\n<p>\u201cThe reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less\u00a0money.</p>\n<p>Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the\u00a0cobbles.</p>\n<p>But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that\u2019d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years\u2019 time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet\u00a0feet.</p>\n<p>This was the Captain Samuel Vimes \u2018Boots\u2019 theory of socioeconomic unfairness.\u201d<br>\u2014 Terry Pratchett</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re good at something, you\u2019ll tell everyone.
